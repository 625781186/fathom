        Once upon a time, there was a large bear named Sid. Sid was very large and bearish, and he had a bag of hammers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sid dreamed of doughnuts--bear claws in particular--and wanted nothing more than to sink his stinking teeth into some. One day, Sid traded the bag of hammers to a serial scribbler named Sam for a dozen doughnuts. It was a good trade. Sid lived happily ever after.

        Did you ever trade a bag of hammers for something? What was it? What were you doing with a bag of hammers, anyway? Don't you know that keeping your hammers in a bag leads to chipped heads? What is wrong with you, anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
        Hamstrung by ham-handed dreams of hammers, you will ham-handedly hamper Hap's handbag handbooks. You'll be handing out handbills by the handful until they handcuff you and handicap your handiworks. What, then, will become of your handkerchief handles?
